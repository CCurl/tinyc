# tinyc

This is a GitHub copy of Mark Feeley's tinyc compiler.

Note: In 2024, I was interested in learning how compilers work, and I came across this.<br/>
I found it here: http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~felipe/IFT2030-Automne2002/Complements/tinyc.c<br/>
Seeing the copyright, I emailed Mark and asked him if I could use it to learn, and he said<br/>
that it was under a MIT license and I could do what I wanted with it.<br/>

I am making a copy here for posterity.
